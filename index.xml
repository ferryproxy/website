The API server is a component of the Kubernetes control plane that exposes the Kubernetes API. The API server is the front end for the Kubernetes control plane
Cluster # A set of worker machines, called nodes, that run containerized applications. Every cluster has at least one worker node.
Controller # In Kubernetes, controllers are control loops that watch the state of your cluster, then make or request changes where needed.</description></item><item><title>Manual Mapping Service</title><link>https://ferryproxy.io/docs/user/examples/manual/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ferryproxy.io/docs/user/examples/manual/</guid><description>Manual Mapping Service # Why this is needed # In some cluster unreachability scenarios, the apiserver address of the data plane needs to be exposed to the control plane in advance so that the control plane can access the apiserver of the data plane.
The routing rules configured by this feature are not controlled by the ferry-controller.

The following capabilities are primarily used
direct-tcpip tcpip-forward direct-streamlocal streamlocal-forward There are two core points
Listen to a local port, connect to the Ferry-Tunnel on the other side, and forward all connections through it Connecting to the peer Ferry-Tunnel and listening to a port, and forwarding connections from the listening port to the local Service Discovery # Each exported service port will be assigned a port in the Ferry-Tunnel of the imported cluster</description></item><item><title>With Service Mesh</title><link>https://ferryproxy.io/docs/user/with-service-mesh/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ferryproxy.io/docs/user/with-service-mesh/</guid><description>With Service Mesh # As verified in Istio, Ferry fits perfectly as long as Sidecar is not injected into the ferry-tunnel</description></item></channel></rss>
